Ecommerce, or electronic commerce, refers to transactions conducted via the internet. 
Every time individuals and companies are buying or selling products and services online 
they’re engaging in ecommerce. The term ecommerce also encompasses other activities 
including online auctions, internet banking, payment gateways, and online ticketing.
Many Ecommerce websites success is determined by the products offered and how well the 
website is marketed, the features the website provides for both the customer and the website 
owner.
So if you’ve ever spent any time looking for recommendations on a new computer, 
chances are someone would have told that “just build a desktop.” There’s a reason: building 
your own desktop is almost always cheaper than buying one from a manufacturer. The problem, 
of course, is it that you need to get your hands dirty. But building a PC in this 21st Century is
